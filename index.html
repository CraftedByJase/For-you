Why Movement Patterns Matter
Movement quality is the foundation of performance and injury prevention. As a coach certified by The Ready State, 102 Movement & Mobility, and Pain Free Performance Specialist (PPSC), I use the latest functional assessments and corrective protocols endorsed by leaders like Kelly Starrett and Dr. John Rusin. Poor patterns lead to joint pain and dysfunction, while resilient movement fortifies tissue health and athletic longevity.

The Seven Fundamental Patterns (PPSC & Ready State)
- Squat: Lower body power, everyday tasks
- Hinge: Posterior chain, picking up objects
- Lunge: Single-leg stability, gait mechanics
- Push: Upper body pressing
- Pull: Back strength, posture
- Carry: Core and grip strength for daily loads
- Rotation: Safe twisting, anti-rotation stability

How to Build Resilience
- Master the basics first. Start with bodyweight; progress gradually.
- Assess movement regularly. Use coach-led screens (FRC, Ready State Mobility 101) to spot and fix compensation early.
- Integrate mobility, not just flexibility. Active control is more protective than passive range.
- Use loaded carries, anti-rotation, and multi-planar drills. Research shows these build whole-body resilience for tactical, farm, and athletic populations.
